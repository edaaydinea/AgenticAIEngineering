# Master AI Agentic Engineering – Build Autonomous AI Agents

This course is your comprehensive guide to mastering agentic AI engineering, focusing on building, evaluating, and deploying autonomous AI agents using both open-source and frontier Large Language Models (LLMs). Through hands-on labs, real-world projects, and in-depth technical notes, you’ll gain the skills to design, implement, and optimize agentic systems for a wide range of applications.

## Course Overview

### Week 1

#### Day 1

**What I did today:**

- Successfully configured the development environment for AI agent engineering, including installing Git, the AI-powered Cursor IDE, and the fast, Rust-based UV package manager, and securely managing API keys using a `.env` file.
- Gained hands-on experience with UV by using `uv sync` to create an isolated Python virtual environment and install project dependencies, and `uv run` to execute Python scripts.
- Executed the first practical lab by interacting with the OpenAI API via Python in a Jupyter notebook, correctly selecting the UV-managed kernel and utilizing `python-dotenv` to load API keys.
- Developed and successfully ran a multi-step "agentic workflow" by orchestrating multiple LLM calls, where one LLM call generated a question/topic and a subsequent call provided an answer/elaboration.
- Observed a foundational element of AI agent autonomy as the LLM independently selected a business sector for analysis within an exercise, demonstrating an ability to make choices within a given framework.
- Learned about the core components of an AI agent through an n8n demo, including triggers, agent nodes, underlying LLMs (OpenAI, Olama as alternative), and the critical role of "tools" (e.g., Philips Hue) for external interactions.
- Received an overview of the six-week course structure, which will progressively introduce various AI agent frameworks including the OpenAI Agents SDK, CrewAI, LangGraph, Microsoft Autogen, and Anthropic's Model Context Protocol.
- Understood the course's practical approach, focusing on building a portfolio of eight commercially relevant projects, such as an agentic software engineering team and a financial markets trading simulation.
- Familiarized myself with the course's supportive learning ecosystem, including comprehensive GitHub guides, supplementary videos, and an emphasis on community engagement via LinkedIn.
- Recognized the importance of patience and problem-solving during the setup of cutting-edge data science environments and the value of using modern tools like Cursor and UV for enhanced productivity.
- Applied the multi-step LLM pattern to a practical exercise, prompting an LLM to identify a business area ripe for AI, a specific pain point, and a proposed AI solution.
- Utilized `IPython.display.Markdown` to render formatted LLM responses within Jupyter notebooks, improving the readability of outputs.
